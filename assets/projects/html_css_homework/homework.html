Programming since the age of 5, he had his first iOS app, tTables, accepted when he was 9 years old. Since then, he has created apps, such as the youth-focused “I Can, We Can!” app, and tID Vault, along with tGuess, a number guessing game for Apple Watch and iPhone, just to name a few.
His YouTUbe series “Tanmay Teaches: Watson” made him the youngest IBM Watson developer.
He has created algorithms, ranging from a recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm, which helps to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, to AskTanmay, one of his most recent creations, is the world’s first web-based NLQA (Natural Language Question Answering) System to be powered by IBM Watson. In fact, it’s open source, so that other developers can learn from it, and build their own QA systems off of it.
In addition to his other keynote speeches, in February of 2016, he was invited for a Keynote at IBM Interconnect 2016 in Las Vegas, where he announced and demonstrated AskTanmay.
